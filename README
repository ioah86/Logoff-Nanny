                  Logoff-Nanny
==================================================

This is a software project to assist parents/guardians to control the
time their kids spend on their computer.

It offers at the current stage the following functionalities:
- Automated Logoff of the user after a specific time in one day was
  spent logged in.
- Distinguishing between weekends and weekdays (i.e. one can set
  different times for those days).
- Customizable duration settings for weekends and weekdays with
  minute-precision.

CONFIGURATION / OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:

At the current stage, the software only runs only on Linux-Systems. It
was tested on Ubuntu 12.04LTS and Edubuntu 13.04. It is written in
Python, and was tested with Python 2.7.

In order to set a custom time that you want your kids to be at most
on the computer, please change the respective constants in the
automated_logoff.py file in the folder /src.

We assume that your kid has a separate account on the computer.

Note here, that for every day, when the kid logs in for the first
time, the program creates a .txt file in
/home/"yourKidsAccountName"/.timeSpec with the file-name representing
the current day. If you want to grant your child more time for a
specific day, please just secretly increase the number in the file to
the desired time in minutes. The file-names and the folder-name are
customizable.

INSTALLATION:

Make sure you read the configuration instruction.

Hide the source-file(s) somewhere on the computer (I personally use
hidden folders for that, as the kids cannot find them on their
own. Once they can, well, then no restriction is needed any more in my
opinion ;-)), and grant the account of your kid reading access to it.

Then, place an autostart entry for your kid's account, such that the
python-file is loaded on startup.

TODO:

- Visualization for the kid considering how much time is left
- Extend to other operating systems
- Test on different Python-versions
- Make it more easy to use-configure for non-Linux-affine -- or more
  general not that computer-affine -- parents.

CHANGELOG:

Current version: 0.1
